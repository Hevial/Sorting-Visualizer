? How does animations works ?

The animate function gets this animations array, with all the steps to do;
The 'action' key is the action that the 'animate' fuction as to do:
    - compare: highlights the two bars that are currently been compared
    - swap: swap the two bars values with the given height1, height2
    - reset: reset the color back to the default one

animations = [
    { barsIdx: [idxBar1,idxBar2], action: "compare"}
    { barsIdx: [idxBar1,idxBar2], barHeight: [height1, height2], action: "swap"}
    { barsIdx: [idxBar1,idxBar2], action: "reset"}
    ...
    !NOTE: if the height1 is missing it will just change the idxbar1 value with the height2
]
